// Description: this file contains the code to call and execute the powershell.dll 
// file generated from the powershell.cpp file
// within the unity editor. It actually compiles fine in unity, but when run it
// gives error: "DllNotFoundException: .dll not found at PATH" even when the dll
// is defintely at that path location. This is probably because the powershell.cpp
// file imports "Windows.h", and the compiler can't find the windows.h .dll, and for
// some reason raises the .dll path of powershell.cpp even though it finds it
// instead of the missing libraries .dll path (according to stack overflow)
